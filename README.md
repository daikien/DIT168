# DIT168

## Introduction
The goal with this project is to create an autonomous car, it is suppose to be able to drive along a “road” and stay within the lane while driving autonomously. Furthermore we will try to implement a “following” feature where the car will be able to follow another car. We will try to write a general protocol for this.
