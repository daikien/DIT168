How to contribute:
Trello board will be used for clarifying contribution. The development team will generate new user stories at the beginning of each development phase(sprint). User stories will be posted on trello board and during the development team meeting. Vertical user stories are recommended but not mandatory for team members to take. When it comes to a big or unfamiliar user story, it is also possible for team members to work on the user story in pair or divided it into serval tasks to implement.

Coding guidelines:
The guidelines for coding will be focused on the following 3 parts. Quality, reduction of complexity, and refactoring. For quality assurance, peer review and pull request are the recommending way for our development team to implement. Reduce the complexity will always be a guideline for team members to keep in mind during the developing phase. The more complex the code is the more likely it is to be buggy, the more difficult the bugs are to find and the more likely there are to be hidden bugs. Refactoring would be helpful when it comes to readability and structure.
